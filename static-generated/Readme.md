# Asset folder

This is a similar folder to the `static` folder, but content is copied selectively based on the environment and config options:
 - `mockServiceWorker.js` - Service worker generated by the msw mocking tool
 - `assets` - compiled asset, In long term it should be deployed into some dedicated CDN. Now it is part of the (generated) static content.
